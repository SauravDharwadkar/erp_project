1. Bootstrap gets loaded twice once in base and again in every "tabs" template.
    This is causing shifting of nav links to left and rounding of corners. 
        Removing tabs bootstrap cdn fixes the issue.

        1.1 bootstrap cdn is not loading in child html pages from base.html
            causing all tables to basic styling.
                we have to figure out other way use bootstrap in base as we
                do need to include bootstrap in tabs html.
