    This is causing shifting of nav links to left and rounding of corners. 
        Removing tabs bootstrap cdn fixes the issue.

        1.1 bootstrap cdn is not loading in child html pages from base.html
            causing all tables to basic styling.

                do need to include bootstrap in tabs html.
